# Demo

A self-contained configuration for a fresh Home Assistant in Docker. It shows:

- **Areas and entity settings:** the three areas onboarding creates are imported, two more are
  created, and each of the demo integration's lights is put into its area.
- **One automation for every area:** `templates/lights_left_on.yaml.tftpl` turns off a light
  that has been on for two hours. Each area with lights gets its own copy, with its lights filled
  in. Change one copy in the UI, and `tofu plan` shows the drift; `tofu apply` makes it match the
  others again. Change the template, and every copy follows.
- **Automations from YAML files**, as copied out of the automation editor
  (`automations/*.yaml`, one `homeassistant_automation` each).
- **Dashboards:** "Home" has one view per area, built with `for` over `homeassistant_entities`.
  A quick-actions section, defined once as a local, is on every view of "Home" and on "Wall
  Tablet".

It needs Docker and OpenTofu ≥ 1.8.

```sh
eval "$(./up.sh)"    # start and onboard Home Assistant; HA_VERSION=2026.5.4 for another version
tofu init
tofu apply
```

Open <http://localhost:8123> and log in as `demo` / `demo-password`. Edit the automation
"Kitchen: lights left on" and run `tofu plan`. `./down.sh` removes the container.
